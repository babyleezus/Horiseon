# Horiseon home page


I was given a task by a marketing agency, of taking an existing website and modifying the code to make it more acessible for users who require assistive technologies. 

The changes I made to accomodate the brief include:

- Using semantic HTML elements in the source code
- Using HTML elements that follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
- Assigning accessible `alt` attributes to images and icons featured on the site
- Arranging headingt o fall in sequential order
- Using title elements with a concise, descriptive title

My final work is showcased at https://babyleezus.github.io/Horiseon/
